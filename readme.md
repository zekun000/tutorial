This code builds and publishes fine. However, when running "cargo test" I get the following errors. It _seems_ like it's not finding the dependencies as I can put a completely bogus path in the Move.toml for AptosFramework and it returns the same errors.  I've tried pointing to the local path and to github - both yeild the same error set. I'm sure it's something simple I'm just not aware of.

One other thing that may or may not be relevant to this issue, but if I run "cargo test" after running "cargo run sources" - I get a whole different set of errors (see error.md).  If I delete the `build` folder, those errors go away and I'm back to these same unbound module errors.
